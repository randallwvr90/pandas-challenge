## The Challenge
I chose to do the Heroes of Pymoli option.

I liked this homework a lot! It was tough but I got the hang of things and was able to do most of the steps on my own by the end. I added some percentages to some of the summary data frames so that I could think about the trends that way - I did this with purchases by age and also with purchases by gender. I wanted to see if the purchases tracked with the number of players in each group or if some groups punched above their weight. It turns out that the purchases tracked the gender and age groups pretty closely so it doesn't seem like anyone really makes more than their share of purchases. See the "My Thoughs" section for more. 

I hope this format is ok. I know I haven't turned in the previous homework assignments (I'm working on getting them done too!) so I might have missed something about how to do this. Please let me know if I need to do anything differently!

## My thoughts
Here are some trends that I found:
1. There are 484 male players, 81 female players, and 11 other / non-disclosed gendered players. This is 84% male. Not surprising for video games, I guess! 
2. I found the percentage of all purchases that each gender group made. It tracks about 1:1 with the number of people in each gender group. Males, for example, make up 84.03% of players, and made 83.59% of purchases. I didn't expect them to track so closely - maybe male players would be more likely to make an in-game purchase. But that wasn't the case here. 
3. Looking at the purchases broken out by age, over 3/4 of all purchases were made by players between the ages of 15 and 29. The 15-19 age group made 136 purchases (17%), the 20-24 age group made 365 purchases (47%), and the 25 to 29 age group made 101 purchases (13%) for a total of 77%. There's also a really big jump between the 10-14 age group and the 15-19 age group. Players aged 10-14 only made 28 purchases (4%) while players aged 15-19 made 136 (17%). It turns out that these numbers just track the number of players in each group though so really it just says something about how many players of each age there are, not really anything about purchase habits of each age group.
