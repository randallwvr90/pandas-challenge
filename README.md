## My thoughts
Here are some trends that I found:
1. There are 484 male players, 81 female players, and 11 other / non-disclosed gendered players. This is 84% male. Not surprising for video games, I guess! 
2. I found the percentage of all purchases that each gender group made. It tracks about 1:1 with the number of people in each gender group. Males, for example, make up 84.03% of players, and made 83.59% of purchases. I didn't expect them to track so closely - maybe male players would be more likely to make an in-game purchase. But that wasn't the case here. 
3. Looking at the purchases broken out by age, over 3/4 of all purchases were made by players between the ages of 15 and 29. The 15-19 age group made 136 purchases (17%), the 20-24 age group made 365 purchases (47%), and the 25 to 29 age group made 101 purchases (13%) for a total of 77%. There's also a really big jump between the 10-14 age group and the 15-19 age group. Players aged 10-14 only made 28 purchases (4%) while players aged 15-19 made 136 (17%).
